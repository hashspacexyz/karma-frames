# Hashspace Channel Karma

channel engagement ❤️ —> token rewards 📈

A reward system that acknowledges and incentivizes every community contributor based on verifiable engagement.

This repo is the frames frontend for the project.

Built during [Onchain Summer Buildathon](https://onchainsummer.xyz/)

## Overview

The channel karma system operates in epochs with two phases:

**1. Accumulation of Points:**

- **Engage**: Earn points by casting, replying, recasting, and liking within the Farcaster channel.
- **On-Chain Points**: calculated with function encoded on-chain.
- **Verification**: Engagement is verified on the Degen Chain.

**2. Claiming Points at the end of an Epoch**

- **Claim Points**: Accrued points can be claimed at the end of each epoch.
- **Token Rewards**: Points distribute ERC20 tokens or other configurable token types.

Epochs drive continuous participation and reward cycles.
